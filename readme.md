# JavaScript Techdegree Project #3: Interactive Form

## Description

This project enhances an interactive registration form for a fictional conference. I used the popular jQuery JavaScript library to validate user input and provide helpful error messages when the user enters invalid information into the form fields. All validation is performed dynamically, controlled by one array which contains all necessary regular expressions, validation messages and additional program logic where necessary.

A live version of this project can be found [here](https://rliess.github.io/signup-form-validation/).

### Some Additional remarks

- All text/email fields are validated in real time, displaying validation messages as needed. Some fields (name, email) display different messages according to the user's input.
- The validation is performed dynamically and controlled by the `aInput[]` array which contains all necessary regular expressions, validation messages and additional program logic where necessary.
- Tested in Chrome, Firefox and Opera
